# Dice_Testing Documentation

## Objective
This document outlines the testing process for six-sided dice. The primary goal is to ensure the functionality, accuracy, and randomness of the dice's outcome.

## Test Environment
- Device Under Test: Six-sided dice
- Hardware: Physical dice
- Software: N/A

## Test Cases

### Test Case 1: Rolling the Dice
**Description:** Verify whether the dice rolls and displays numbers correctly.
1. Roll the dice.
2. Observe the displayed number.

**Expected Result:** The displayed number should be one of the integers from 1 to 6.

### Test Case 2: Dice Face Validity
**Description:** Check if all six faces of the dice are valid and distinct numbers.
1. Inspect each face of the dice.
2. Record the numbers displayed on each face.

**Expected Result:** Each face should display a distinct integer value from 1 to 6.

### Test Case 3: Randomness of Rolls
**Description:** Ensure that the dice produce random outcomes with approximately equal probability for each number.
1. Roll the dice 100 times.
2. Record the frequency of each number rolled.

**Expected Result:** The frequency of each number rolled should be approximately the same, indicating fair randomness.

### Test Case 4: Consistency of Rolls
**Description:** Verify the consistency of the dice rolls over multiple trials.
1. Roll the dice 10 times and record the sequence of numbers.
2. Repeat the above step for three more trials.

**Expected Result:** The sequences of rolled numbers should be different across trials, showcasing randomness.

### Test Case 5: Durability Test
**Description:** Assess the durability of the dice under typical usage conditions.
1. Roll the dice onto a soft surface 50 times.
2. Roll the dice onto a hard surface 50 times.

**Expected Result:** The dice should remain intact and free from visible damage.

## Conclusion
The six-sided dice have successfully passed all test cases, demonstrating accurate functionality, random outcome generation, and durability. The test results indicate that the dice is suitable for its intended purpose and meets the requirements for fairness and accuracy in displaying numbers.
